# Log Parsing Project

This project consists of two Python scripts: `0-generator.py` and `0-stats.py`, designed for generating and processing simulated web server logs.

## Project Overview

The purpose of the `0-generator.py` script is to simulate a web server's log entries with random IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP status codes, and file sizes. The `0-stats.py` script then processes this simulated log data, counting the occurrence of different HTTP status codes and displaying the file size as the log is generated.

## Scripts

### `0-generator.py`

This script generates a sequence of simulated log entries. Each log entry is formatted as follows:
