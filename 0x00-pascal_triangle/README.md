# Pascal's Triangle Generator

This project contains a Python function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Description

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of integers where:
- Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
- The first and last values in each row are always `1`.

This implementation generates Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers, where each inner list represents a row of the triangle.
