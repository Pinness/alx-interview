# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves writing a function to rotate a square 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, in place. The function operates directly on the input matrix without creating a new one, ensuring memory efficiency.

## Prototype
```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates a square 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place.
    Args:
        matrix (list of list of int): The n x n 2D matrix to rotate.
    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in place.
    """
